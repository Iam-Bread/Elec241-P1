FPGA - FPGA project folder. Open the .qpf file using Quartus 16.1 to test the FPGA components on actual hardware.
You should not modify anything in this folder

lib - FPGA source files shared with other projects. Again, do NOT modify anything in this folder.

MCU - the Microcontroller code used to test your hardware. Inside there is a Keil uVision project.

uut - Units Under Test. This is where the 4 components are to be found.

tests - This is where you put your benchmarks

Your task is to modify the architecture of these files. Do NOT change any filenames or edit the entity of any component.
